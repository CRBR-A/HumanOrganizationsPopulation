| Population: | 12,864,634 (July 2020 est.) |
| Population: | note: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected |

| Languages: | French (official), Fon and Yoruba (most common vernaculars in south), tribal languages (at least six major ones in north) |

| Demographic profile: | Benin has a youthful age structure â€“ almost 65% of the population is under the age of 25 â€“ which is bolstered by high fertility and population growth rates. Beninâ€™s total fertility has been falling over time but remains high, declining from almost 7 children per women in 1990 to 4.8 in 2016. Beninâ€™s low contraceptive use and high unmet need for contraception contribute to the sustained high fertility rate. Although the majority of Beninese women use skilled health care personnel for antenatal care and delivery, the high rate of maternal mortality indicates the need for more access to high quality obstetric care. |
| Demographic profile: | Poverty, unemployment, increased living costs, and dwindling resources increasingly drive the Beninese to migrate. An estimated 4.4 million, more than 40%, of Beninese live abroad. Virtually all Beninese emigrants move to West African countries, particularly Nigeria and Cote dâ€™Ivoire. Of the less than 1% of Beninese emigrants who settle in Europe, the vast majority live in France, Beninâ€™s former colonial ruler. |
| Demographic profile: | With about 40% of the population living below the poverty line, many desperate parents resort to sending their children to work in wealthy households as domestic servants (a common practice known as vidomegon), mines, quarries, or agriculture domestically or in Nigeria and other neighboring countries, often under brutal conditions. Unlike in other West African countries, where rural people move to the coast, farmers from Beninâ€™s densely populated southern and northwestern regions move to the historically sparsely populated central region to pursue agriculture. Immigrants from West African countries came to Benin in increasing numbers between 1992 and 2002 because of its political stability and porous borders. |
