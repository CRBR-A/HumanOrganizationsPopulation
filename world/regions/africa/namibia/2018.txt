| --- | --- |
| Population: | 2,533,224 (July 2018 est.) |
| Population: | note: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected |
| Nationality: | noun: Namibian(s) |
| Nationality: | adjective: Namibian |
| Ethnic groups: | black 87.5%, white 6%, mixed 6.5% |
| Ethnic groups: | note: about 50% of the population belong to the Ovambo tribe and 9% to the Kavangos tribe; other indigenous ethnic groups include Herero 7%, Damara 7%, Nama 5%, Caprivian 4%, San 3%, Baster 2%, Tswana 0.5% |
| Languages: | Oshiwambo languages 49.7%, Nama/Damara 11%, Kavango languages 10.4%, Afrikaans 9.4% (common language of most of the population and about 60% of the white population), Herero languages 9.2%, Zambezi languages 4.9%, English (official) 2.3%, other African languages 1.5%, other European languages .7%, other 1% (2016 est.) |
| Languages: | note: Namibia has 13 recognized national languages, including 10 indigenous African languages and 3 Indo-European languages |
| Religions: | Christian 80% to 90% (at least 50% Lutheran), indigenous beliefs 10% to 20% |
| Demographic profile: | Planning officials view Namibiaâ€™s reduced population growth rate as sustainable based on the countryâ€™s economic growth over the past decade. Prior to independence in 1990, Namibiaâ€™s relatively small population grew at about 3% annually, but declining fertility and the impact of HIV/AIDS slowed this growth to 1.4% by 2011, rebounding to close to 2% by 2016. Namibiaâ€™s fertility rate has fallen over the last two decades â€“ from about 4.5 children per woman in 1996 to 3.4 in 2016 â€“ due to increased contraceptive use, higher educational attainment among women, and greater female participation in the labor force. The average age at first birth has stayed fairly constant, but the age at first marriage continues to increase, indicating a rising incidence of premarital childbearing. |
| Demographic profile: | The majority of Namibians are rural dwellers (about 55%) and live in the better-watered north and northeast parts of the country. Migration, historically male-dominated, generally flows from northern communal areas â€“ non-agricultural lands where blacks were sequestered under the apartheid system â€“ to agricultural, mining, and manufacturing centers in the center and south. After independence from South Africa, restrictions on internal movement eased, and rural-urban migration increased, bolstering urban growth. |
| Demographic profile: | Some Namibians â€“ usually persons who are better-educated, more affluent, and from urban areas â€“ continue to legally migrate to South Africa temporarily to visit family and friends and, much less frequently, to pursue tertiary education or better economic opportunities. Namibians concentrated along the countryâ€™s other borders make unauthorized visits to Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or Botswana, to visit family and to trade agricultural goods. Few Namibians express interest in permanently settling in other countries; they prefer the safety of their homeland, have a strong national identity, and enjoy a well-supplied retail sector. Although Namibia is receptive to foreign investment and cross-border trade, intolerance toward non-citizens is widespread. |
