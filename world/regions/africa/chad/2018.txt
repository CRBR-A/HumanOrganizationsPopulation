| Demographic profile: | Despite the start of oil production in 2003, 40% of Chadâ€™s population lives below the poverty line. The population will continue to grow rapidly because of the countryâ€™s very high fertility rate and large youth cohort â€“ more than 65% of the populace is under the age of 25 â€“ although the mortality rate is high and life expectancy is low. Chad has the worldâ€™s third highest maternal mortality rate. Among the primary risk factors are poverty, anemia, rural habitation, high fertility, poor education, and a lack of access to family planning and obstetric care. Impoverished, uneducated adolescents living in rural areas are most affected. To improve womenâ€™s reproductive health and reduce fertility, Chad will need to increase womenâ€™s educational attainment, job participation, and knowledge of and access to family planning. Only about a quarter of women are literate, less than 5% use contraceptives, and more than 40% undergo genital cutting. |
| Demographic profile: | As of October 2017, more than 320,000 refugees from Sudan and more than 75,000 from the Central African Republic strain Chadâ€™s limited resources and create tensions in host communities. Thousands of new refugees fled to Chad in 2013 to escape worsening violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. The large refugee populations are hesitant to return to their home countries because of continued instability. Chad was relatively stable in 2012 in comparison to other states in the region, but past fighting between government forces and opposition groups and inter-communal violence have left nearly 60,000 of its citizens displaced in the eastern part of the country. |
