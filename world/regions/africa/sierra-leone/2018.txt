| Religions: | Muslim 78.6%, Christian 20.8%, other 0.3%, unspecified 0.2% (2013 est.) |
| Demographic profile: | Sierra Leoneâ€™s youthful and growing population is driven by its high total fertility rate (TFR) of almost 5 children per woman, which has declined little over the last two decades. Its elevated TFR is sustained by the continued desire for large families, the low level of contraceptive use, and the early start of childbearing. Despite its high TFR, Sierra Leoneâ€™s population growth is somewhat tempered by high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates that are among the worldâ€™s highest and are a result of poverty, a lack of potable water and sanitation, poor nutrition, limited access to quality health care services, and the prevalence of female genital cutting. |
| Demographic profile: | Sierra Leoneâ€™s large youth cohort â€“ about 60% of the population is under the age of 25 â€“ continues to struggle with high levels of unemployment, which was one of the major causes of the countryâ€™s 1991-2002 civil war and remains a threat to stability today. Its estimated 60% youth unemployment rate is attributed to high levels of illiteracy and unskilled labor, a lack of private sector jobs, and low pay. |
| Demographic profile: | Sierra Leone has been a source of and destination for refugees. Sierra Leoneâ€™s civil war internally displaced as many as 2 million people, or almost half the population, and forced almost another half million to seek refuge in neighboring countries (370,000 Sierra Leoneans fled to Guinea and 120,000 to Liberia). The UNHCR has helped almost 180,000 Sierra Leoneans to return home, while more than 90,000 others have repatriated on their own. Of the more than 65,000 Liberians who took refuge in Sierra Leone during their countryâ€™s civil war (1989-2003), about 50,000 have been voluntarily repatriated by the UNHCR and others have returned home independently. As of 2015, less than 1,000 Liberians still reside in Sierra Leone. |
