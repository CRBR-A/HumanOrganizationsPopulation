| Passport/Visa Requirements | US citizens should make sure their passport will not expire for at least 6 months after they enter the country even if they do not intend to stay that long. They should also make sure they have at least 1 blank page in their passport for any entry stamp that will be required. A visa is not needed for tourists, but US citizens must purchase a tourist card (10 USD) upon arrival, which is valid for 90 days. If a US citizen's passport shows they were born in El Salvador then they do not need to purchase tourist card. |
| Vaccinations | An International Certificate of Vaccination for yellow fever is required for travelers arriving from countries with a risk of yellow fever transmission and for travelers having transited through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. See WHO recommendations.  <http://www.who.int/> |
