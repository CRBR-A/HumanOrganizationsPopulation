| Passport/Visa Requirements | US citizens should make sure their passport will not expire for at least 30 days after they enter the country even if they do not intend to stay that long. They should also make sure they have at least 2 blank pages in their passport for any entry stamp that will be required. A visa is not required as long as you do not stay in the country more than 89 days. Currently South Africa requires that children travel with birth certificates, valid passports, and (if not traveling with both of the parents on the birth certificate), a parental consent letter from both of the parents. |
| Vaccinations | Yellow fever vaccine, at least 10 days before arrival, is required for travelers originating from or transiting through WHO-designated yellow fever countries. See WHO recommendations.  <http://www.who.int/> |
