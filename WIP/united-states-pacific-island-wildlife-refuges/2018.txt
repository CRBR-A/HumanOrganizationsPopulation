| Maritime claims: | territorial sea: 12 nm |

| Climate: | Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands: equatorial; scant rainfall, constant wind, burning sun; |
| | Johnston Atoll and Kingman Reef: tropical, but generally dry; consistent northeast trade winds with little seasonal temperature variation; |
| | Midway Islands: subtropical with cool, moist winters (December to February) and warm, dry summers (May to October); moderated by prevailing easterly winds; most of the 107 cm of annual rainfall occurs during the winter; |
| | Palmyra Atoll: equatorial, hot; located within the low pressure area of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where the northeast and southeast trade winds meet, it is extremely wet with between 400-500 cm of rainfall each year |
| Terrain: | low and nearly flat sandy coral islands with narrow fringing reefs that have developed at the top of submerged volcanic mountains, which in most cases rise steeply from the ocean floor |
| Elevation: | 0 m lowest point: Pacific Ocean |
| | 8 highest point: Baker Island, unnamed location - 3 Howland Island, unnamed location - 7 Jarvis Island, unnamed location - 10 Johnston Atoll, Sand Island - 2 Kingman Reef, unnamed location - less than 13 Midway Islands, unnamed location - 3 Palmyra Atoll, unnamed location - |
| Natural resources: | terrestrial and aquatic wildlife |
| Land use: | agricultural land: 0% (2011 est.) |
| | arable land: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent crops: 0% (2011 est.) / permanent pasture: 0% (2011 est.) |
| | forest: 0% (2011 est.) |
| | other: 100% (2011 est.) |
| Natural hazards: | Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands: the narrow fringing reef surrounding the island poses a maritime hazard; |
| | Kingman Reef: wet or awash most of the time, maximum elevation of less than 2 m makes Kingman Reef a maritime hazard; |
| | Midway Islands, Johnston, and Palmyra Atolls: NA |
| Environment - current issues: | Baker Island: no natural freshwater resources; feral cats, introduced in 1937 during a short-lived colonization effort, ravaged the avian population and were eradicated in 1965 |
| | Howland Island: no natural freshwater resources; the island habitat has suffered from invasive exotic species; black rats, introduced in 1854, were eradicated by feral cats within a year of their introduction in 1937; the cats preyed on the bird population and were eliminated by 1985 |
| | Jarvis Island: no natural freshwater resources; feral cats, introduced in the 1930s during a short-lived colonization venture, were not completely removed until 1990 |
| | Johnston Atoll: no natural freshwater resources; the seven decades under US military administration (1934-2004) left the atoll environmentally degraded and required large-scale remediation efforts; a swarm of Anoplolepis (crazy) ants invaded the island in 2010 damaging native wildlife; eradication has been largely, but not completely, successful |
| | Midway Islands:Â  many exotic species introduced, 75% of the roughly 200 plant species on the island are non-native; plastic pollution harms wildlife, via entanglement, ingestion, and toxic contamination |
| | Kingman Reef: none |
| | Palmyra Atoll: black rats, believed to have been introduced to the atoll during the US military occupation of the 1940s, severely degraded the ecosystem outcompeting native species (seabirds, crabs); following a successful rat removal project in 2011, native flora and fauna have begun to recover |
| Geography - note: | Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands: scattered vegetation consisting of grasses, prostrate vines, and low growing shrubs; primarily a nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife; closed to the public; |
| | Johnston Atoll: Johnston Island and Sand Island are natural islands, which have been expanded by coral dredging; North Island (Akau) and East Island (Hikina) are manmade islands formed from coral dredging; the egg-shaped reef is 34 km in circumference; closed to the public; |
| | Kingman Reef: barren coral atoll with deep interior lagoon; closed to the public; |
| | Midway Islands: a coral atoll managed as a National Wildlife Refuge and open to the public for wildlife-related recreation in the form of wildlife observation and photography; |
| | Palmyra Atoll: the high rainfall and resulting lush vegetation make the environment of this atoll unique among the US Pacific Island territories; supports a large undisturbed stand of Pisonia beach forest |
